Lab 1 Question:

Q: Did the execution of the makefile create any warnings? What do you think is going on with the makefile? Briefly write up what you think to hand in.

A: The only warning that I got was when the make file tries to set the 
frequency of the microcontroller. I believe that the software that handles is able to set it properly and thus the program works as it is supposed to. It gives me this warning twice, but regardless of this warning the program works fine.

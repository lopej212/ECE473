# ECE473
This repository will hold all of the labs and in-class assignments for ECE473 Fall2019 at Oregon State University 
Lab 6 is the final project that puts together the rest of the labs. Lab 6 is a FM Radio Alarm Clock with local and remote temeprature sensing. The system was implemented on ATmega128 & ATmega168 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.

## Final Project 
This is the final alarm clock all put together. I acknowledge there is more work to do here, but it is functional. As in any class you are always in a time crunch to design, develop, and implement in a very short time frame.
